Miscellaneous small utilities to aid with learning Japanese

* [Paste sentence](https://watun.github.io/paste) - small tool that allows you to paste text from your clipboard into `<p>` elements, made to be used with [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) or [rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=ja). Also features a small textarea for typing, dictionary links, and a log for previously pasted text.
